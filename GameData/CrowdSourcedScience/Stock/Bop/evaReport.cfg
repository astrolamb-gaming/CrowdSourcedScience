        BopSrfLanded* = You feel uneasy. This place is dark and inhospitable.
        BopSrfLanded* = You feel that something is wrong. Even more so than when you were in your spacecraft. You feel like there's something behind you, but when you turn around, nothing is there.

        BopSrfLandedPeaks* = The low gravity is counterbalanced by a strong attraction to Jool. It is very green.
        BopSrfLandedPeaks* = Mission Control tells you not to take off your helmet.

        BopSrfLandedRidges* = You note that it seems boring here, and wish you'd been allowed to bring the beach ball you wanted to.
		BopSrfLandedRidges* = The wasteland stretches out before you, while Jool looks on overhead. You think you see a green dot in the distance... Is it something of interest, or is it just a reflection of Jool?

        BopSrfLandedPoles* = There's something ominous lurking here... you just know it.
		BopSrfLandedPoles* = You try to shrug off a feeling of being watched. Surely there's no one else on this airless moon!

        BopSrfLandedSlopes* = The air feels murky and ominous. A second later, you remember there is no air on Bop, so it's probably just your suit being out of order.
		BopSrfLandedSlopes* = The regolith underfoot is very rough. Some pieces appear quite sharp, and you fear one of them might poke a hole in your suit.
		BopSrfLandedSlopes* = You trip on a small rock. Fortunately, you fall quite slowly.

        BopSrfLandedValley* = You look around at the tops of the round lumps around you and think you see a small flash in the distance. You put down "weird" in the mission report.
		BopSrfLandedValley* = Mission Control seems concerned when you tell them the regolith looks like sand. They seem glad there's no water nearby. You hear a cut-off comment about "water for a Krak..."

        BopInSpaceLowPeaks* = I wish that we were not here.
        BopInSpaceLowPeaks* = I can see the ship from up here!

        BopInSpaceHigh* = The moon strikingly resembles a potato.
        BopInSpaceHigh* = Mission Control tells you that Bop is that little brown thing. You had gone on EVA to move it away from the ship.
        BopInSpaceHigh* = Bop looks disturbingly like Gilly. You hope you will be able to make it home this time.
