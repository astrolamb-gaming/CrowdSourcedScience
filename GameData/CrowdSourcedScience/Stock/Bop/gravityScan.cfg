    %RESULTS
    {
        BopSrfLanded* = There seems to be a spike over one location... wait, it's gone now.
		BobSrfLanded* = The gravity is very low. You wonder how high you can jump.
		BobSrfLanded* = You consider that the scanner is about the size of a basketball. You conclude that shooting some hoops would be a far more exiting test of Bob's gravity.

        BopSrfLandedPeaks* = The scanner seems split between Jool and Bop. You put it down to a defect.
        BopSrfLandedPeaks* = The scanner refuses to point at Bop. After frantic calls to the manufacturer, Mission Control tells you that it is rated too high.

        BopSrfLandedRidges* = You stare out across the wasteland that is the surface of Bop, and forget to check the gravity scanner's readings.
		BopSrfLandedRidges* = You poke at the instrument, and its start to roll downhill. You run after it frantically, hoping it doesn't break.

        BopSrfLandedPoles* = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.
		BopSrfLandedPoles* = As you move to check the readings, Kerbol hides behind a ridge, throwing the scanner into darkness. You think you hear an eerie noise - is it the Kraken, coming to eat you? You run back to your capsule to hide.

        BopSrfLandedSlopes* = The instrument keeps trying to roll down the ridge. Scolding it like your grandmother scolded you doesn't seem to help.
		BobSrfLandedSlopes* = The readings seem a bit off... was this instrument designed to work on a slope? Mission Control declines to answer.

        BopSrfLandedValley* = You get weird results. Something seems Krakeny...
		BobSrfLandedValley* = The scanner tries to run away... you assume the Goo has been teaching it bad habits.

        BopInSpaceLowPeaks* = The peaks seem rather close. The gravity scanner agrees.
        BopInSpaceLowPeaks* = Scanning returns a result of "0".

        //BopInSpaceLowRidges* =
        //BopInSpaceLowPoles* =
        //BopInSpaceLowSlopes* =
        //BopInSpaceLowValley* =

        BopInSpaceHigh* = The gravity levels are fluctuating slightly. Not enough to cause any obvious problems, but enough to indicate that there is more to Bop than we currently understand.

        BopInSpaceHighPeaks* = The scanner is still pointing at Jool.
        BopInSpaceHighPeaks* = What does this "%NaN%" mean? Mission Control tells you to watch out for Krakens.

        //BopInSpaceHighRidges* =
        //BopInSpaceHighPoles* =
        //BopInSpaceHighSlopes* =
        //BopInSpaceHighValley* =
    }
